# Introduction
This repository contains all of my solutions to the problems I've solved on Project Euler.  Most, if not all of my solutions are written in Python.

# Realizations
Problem 7
Found that holding all prime numbers in an array vs just using a counter variable had no noticeable speed difference.

Problem 8
Found that Python can work with huge variables -- there doesn't seem to be a limit as to how big an "int" is in Python
