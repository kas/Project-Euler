# Introduction
This repository contains all of my solutions to the problems I've solved on Project Euler.  Most, if not all of my solutions are written in Python.

# Realizations
**Problem 007**
* Found that holding all prime numbers in an array vs just using a counter variable had no noticeable speed difference.

**Problem 008**
* Found that Python can work with huge variables -- there doesn't seem to be a limit as to how big an "int" is in Python

**Problem 020**
* Found out how to enable utf-8 character encoding in python file

**Problem 022**
* Learned file IO with python
