# Introduction

This repository contains all of my solutions to the problems I've solved on Project Euler.  Most, if not all of my solutions are written in Python.

# Realizations

**Problem 007**

* Found that holding all prime numbers in an array vs just using a counter variable had no noticeable speed difference.

**Problem 008**

* Found that Python can work with huge variables -- there doesn't seem to be a limit as to how big an "int" is in Python

**Problem 020**

* Found out how to enable utf-8 character encoding in Python file

**Problem 022**

* Learned file IO with Python
* Learned how to dump objects into JSON files and load objects from JSON files in Python

**Problem 025**

* Realized Python has a limit of 999 calls on a recursive function

**Problem 029**

* Realized Python uses sets to create unordered distinct lists, and that you can convert a set back into a list to get the length of it

**Problem 036**

* Realized that my palindrone() and palindroneString() methods (from problem 004) won't work in Python 3

**Problem 056**

* Realized that using math.pow(a,b) returned different results than the correct a**b
